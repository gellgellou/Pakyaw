        Manny Pacquiao competed in professional boxing from 1995 to 2021. Regarded by boxing historians as one of the greatest professional boxers of all time, Pacquiao is the only boxer in history to win twelve major world titles in eight different weight divisions. He is also the first boxer in history to win the lineal championship in five different weight divisions, as well as being the first boxer in history to win major world titles in four of the original eight weight divisions of boxing, also known as the "glamour divisions": flyweight, featherweight, lightweight and welterweight.

        In July 2019, Pacquiao became the oldest welterweight world champion in history at the age of 40, and the first boxer to become a recognized four-time welterweight champion after defeating Keith Thurman to win the WBA (Super) welterweight title. Pacquiao also holds the record of being the only boxer to hold world titles in four different decades, in the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.

        He was named Fighter of the Decade for the 2000s by the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA), WBC, WBO and HBO. He is also a three-time Ring magazine, ESPN and BWAA Fighter of the Year, winning both awards in 2006, 2008 and 2009; and the Best Fighter ESPY Award in 2009 and 2011. In 2016, Pacquiao was ranked second on ESPN's list of top boxers, pound-for-pound, of the past 25 years. BoxRec ranks Pacquiao as the fourth greatest boxer, pound for pound, of all time, as well as the greatest Asian boxer of all time. Boxing historian Bert Sugar ranked Pacquiao as the greatest southpaw fighter of all time. Spanish media outlet Marca placed Pacquiao 16th on their Greatest Sportsmen of the 21st Century list. In 2021, Pacquiao held the top spot in DAZN's list of the top 10 boxers of the previous 30 years and as of 2022, he was ranked ninth in The Ring's list of the top 100 boxers of all time.

        Pacquiao was long rated as the best active boxer in the world, pound-for-pound, by most sporting news and boxing websites, including ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Sporting Life, Yahoo! Sports, About.com, BoxRec and The Ring, beginning from his climb to lightweight until his losses at welterweight in 2012. He was also the longest reigning top-ten active boxer on The Ring's pound-for-pound list.

        Pacquiao has generated approximately 20.4 million total pay-per-view (PPV) buys and $1.29 billion in revenue from his 26 PPV bouts. According to Forbes, he was the second highest paid athlete in the world in 2015.</div>
